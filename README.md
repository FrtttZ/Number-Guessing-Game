# Number-Guessing-Game
### project URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game
  This game is a project created for the website 'roadmap.sh'. The game has 3 levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level has different chances. The game runs a welcome function to welcome the user and prints the various kinds of levels. The program then asks for the desired level and the game begins. The program imported a random library to get random numbers for the users to guess. The program then asks for the user's guess and compares it to the random number generated. If guessed wrong the guessing game continues as long as it doesn't reach the number of chances. If the user guessed it right, the program prints out a congratulation and then asks the user if they wish to play again. The game restarts if the user prompts 'yes' and ends otherwise.
